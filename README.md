# Steps to Run a React Application from GitHub:
React.js web development practice

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation
1. Clone the Repository:
Open your command-line interface (CLI) and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
Use the following command to clone the repository:
type in terminal
git clone <https://github.com/shakeel159/React.js_practice>

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
After cloning, navigate into the project directory:
Type in terminal
cd <project-directory>
Replace <project-directory> with the name of the directory created when you cloned the repository.
### `npm run build` fails to minify

3. Install Dependencies:
Once inside the project directory, install the necessary dependencies (including React and other packages) using npm:
Type in terminal
npm install
This command reads the package.json file of the project and installs all the dependencies listed there.

4. Run the Application:
After the dependencies are installed, you can start the React application using npm:
type in terminal
npm start
This command starts the development server and opens your default web browser to display the running React application.
