# Steps to Run a React Application from GitHub:
React.js web development practice

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation
# 1. Clone the Repository:
<p>Open your command-line interface (CLI) and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.<br>
Use the following command to clone the repository:<br>
 type in terminal:<br>
* git clone <https://github.com/shakeel159/React.js_practice></https:><br>

# 2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
After cloning, navigate into the project directory:<br>
 Type in terminal:<br>
* cd <project-directory><br>
Replace <project-directory> with the name of the directory created when you cloned the repository.<br>

# 3. Install Dependencies:
Once inside the project directory, install the necessary dependencies (including React and other packages) using npm:<br>
 Type in terminal:<br>
* npm install<br>
This command reads the package.json file of the project and installs all the dependencies listed there.<br>

# 4. Run the Application:<br>
After the dependencies are installed, you can start the React application using npm:<br>
 type in terminal:<br>
* npm start<br>
This command starts the development server and opens your default web browser to display the running React application.<br></p>
