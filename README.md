# Steps to Run a React Application from GitHub:
React.js web development practice

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation
#1. Clone the Repository:\n
Open your command-line interface (CLI) and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
Use the following command to clone the repository:
type in terminal
git clone <https://github.com/shakeel159/React.js_practice>

#2. Navigate to the Project Directory:\n
After cloning, navigate into the project directory:\n
Type in terminal:\n
cd <project-directory>\n
Replace <project-directory> with the name of the directory created when you cloned the repository.\n

#3. Install Dependencies:\n
Once inside the project directory, install the necessary dependencies (including React and other packages) using npm:\n
Type in terminal:\n
npm install\n
This command reads the package.json file of the project and installs all the dependencies listed there.\n

#4. Run the Application:\n
After the dependencies are installed, you can start the React application using npm:\n
type in terminal:\n
npm start\n
This command starts the development server and opens your default web browser to display the running React application.\n
